ISSUES:
1. Reverse ground check - for my jump mechanic, I decided to create a method that would check if the player is on the ground. I did this by sending a sphere cast to the players feet and depending on whether
or not the player is touching the ground, the check will adjust accordingly. Somehow, this was easier said then done as for some reason, Unity was throwing a wrench into my work flow and making me play doctor
House. The solution, I had to change the logic on the if statement so that if the condition is not true, than the check is true. (I already lost a couple brain cells when that solution worked, but the check
now works and "As long as it works that's what matters" - Lixian, LixianTV)
